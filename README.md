# JavaConditionalStatements
The provided code is a Java program that implements the FizzBuzz game. It takes a number as input and checks if it is divisible by 5, divisible by 3, or both.

If the number is divisible by both 5 and 3, it prints "FizzBuzz!".
If the number is only divisible by 5, it prints "Fizz".
If the number is only divisible by 3, it prints "Buzz".
If the number is not divisible by either 5 or 3, it prints a message indicating that the number is not divisible by 5 or 3.

The program uses a Scanner object to read the input from the user. It then applies conditional statements to determine the appropriate output based on the divisibility of the number.
